2021/12/15 23:30:39,"That's what I enjoy, always driving on the limit of what you can do.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:40,"If you are not allowed to defend, what's racing about, then?",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:41,We are getting way too much info in the cockpit. Sometimes I switch off the display in my car!,Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:42,"It is very unfair, and on social media you have all these keyboard warriors who just type something, and they never say it to my face. That's very weak I find.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:43,"Of course there will be difficult times, and there will be more in the future, but I know what I have to do in the car.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:44,"For me, it doesn't matter if you are fighting a world champion or not.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:46,"People always think they know better. In football, everybody thinks they can be head coach and do it better. It's the same in F1: they always know better, even if they have no experience of it.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:47,"I say what I think, and if somebody attacks me unfairly, I definitely tell them.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:49,"There is no such thing as a low risk lap in Monaco. It doesn't exist if you want to be fast, because you have to be on the limit.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:50,I get really tired of all the comments saying I should change my approach.,Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:51,I never even think of the mental side of things because I never had any issues.,Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:30:52,"It's just racing. Sometimes you have difficult moments, and then you try to work hard, and you keep working hard, and you overcome the situation. It's as simple as that.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:02,"In general, the spotlight has been on me.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:03,It is not because others tell me I have to change my driving style that I will change.,Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:04,Overtaking is one thing. That is an art. But defending as well. You should be able to defend your position.,Max Verstappen

2021/12/15 23:31:08,"It doesn't matter as long as, at one point, I'm in a championship-winning car. I don't care about my team-mate.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:10,"My dad always told me you have to be as quick as you can straight away out of the box. Some people say, 'Feel your way into it; build it up.' No. My dad would say, 'Straight away, you have to be there.' And I think that helps to warm up your tyres and brakes to be on it a bit more from lap one.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:11,"I think, in general, not only in Formula One but just in a lot of sports, when younger people come in and they do well, there's always a bit of talk going on. I think that's pretty normal.",Max Verstappen
2021/12/15 23:31:13,"The way I drive, the way I handle a car, is an expression of my inner feelings.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:20,"Generally, I hate training - just like most people, I guess. I try to make it fun and varied.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:24,"I had a lot of racism growing up where I grew up. Bullied at school. It definitely encouraged me. It's like battle wounds - you come out the other side, and it just makes you tougher.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:26,"When I was a kid and Christmas was coming up, my dad would ask me what I wanted, and I always said a motorbike. I kept asking for one, and he said it was too dangerous and bought me a go-kart instead.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:32,"If I don't travel, if I stay at home for a week, I would go out of my mind. That is just the way I am. I love to be on the move, and I am fortunate that I have friends all over the world.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:33,"Nothing can really prepare you for when you get in the Formula One car. Knowing that you're driving a multimillion-dollar car, and if you crash it it's going to cost a lot of money, and they might not give you another chance, is scary.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:35,Sometimes it takes time to find people in the sport who share the same opinions and approach to racing as me.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:36,You save most fuel by lifting and coasting in the heavy braking zones at the end of long straights into slow corners.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:37,"Racing is what I love, so it's pretty simple. I want to keep doing it and keep winning.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:39,"I feel equal to Mexicans, Asians, everyone. That's the kind of positive message I want to get out.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:40,"I'm an extremist so I'm either hated or loved. I think it's down to when I first got to Formula One not always knowing what I was saying, saying things that mean one thing but people were taking the other way and then people don't forget.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:41,"I'm keen on hiking. And in Monaco, I also like water skiing, wakeboarding, and jet-skiing, which are all pretty good for your arms, legs, and core stability.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:43,What people tend to forget is the journey that I had getting to Formula One. There were plenty of years where I had to learn about losing and having bad races.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:44,Ayrton Senna was an incredible legend who will be remembered and admired forever.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:45,I am a motorbike fanatic - always have been. It's actually what I wanted to do before I got into motor racing.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:46,"People might not know, but F1 drivers have new helmets made throughout the season. Usually, the design is the same, but I like to do something special for Monaco.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:48,"I'm no less focused than any of my peers. They live a different life. They go home; they are not pictured at events. I train just as much as them, maybe more.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:50,"I'm definitely conscious of time. I already waste so much of it, just on a flight. I look back to when I was 13, and I wish I had stuck with my piano studies.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:51,"You can knock me down, but I get up twice as strong.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:31:52,I don't aspire to be like other drivers - I aspire to be unique in my own way.,Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:31:56,"As a driver, you've always got to believe in your heart that you've got what it takes to win it. You've always got to believe in yourself. You've always got to arrive on the day and believe it can happen. You've always got to believe in the positives.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:32:01,"I think it's a shame that people are so quick to put you in a box; sometimes it's as if you do one thing, and that's all you're allowed to do.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:03,"When I first started in Formula 1, I tried to ignore the fact I was the first black guy ever to race in the sport. But, as I've got older, I've really started to appreciate the implications.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:04,There have been some ups and downs. I've not always had it my own way. That's the way racing is supposed to be.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:05,"Going for a really long run, a bike ride, or cross-country skiing helps me get away from all the noise. I tell myself, 'The pain you're feeling, just enjoy it because it's going to help you across that finish line first.' If you're having a crap day, go for a run. It makes a big difference.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:06,"I like taking risks. I like trying new things, whether it be style or restaurants or whatever.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:07,"I don't drive by the seat of my pants and happen to win races. I work very hard to interpret the data and drive a certain way. My engineers have confidence in me, and more often than not, when I tell them what I need or what I am feeling with the car, it's right.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:09,Ayrton Senna was my favorite driver who I wanted to be like.,Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:32:12,"All in all, racing with lift and coast is actually harder.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:13,"Since I started driving in F1 in 2006-07, the cars have got slower and easier to drive.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:14,"When I was really young, I busted my nose when I was racing. The first thing my dad asked me was: 'Are you OK?' I said, 'Can you fix the car for tomorrow?' And I won the race the next day.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:15,"Despite the name, 'lift and coast' does not mean cruising. You're trying to be as fast as you can, and you're still going through the corner on the limit, but you have to approach the corner slightly differently; otherwise, you won't make the end of the race.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:16,"It is open for anyone to have freedom of speech, and I guess we can all play a role in trying to make a difference in the world. Particularly if your leader is not helping in that area.",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:17,Equalising performance between teams runs completely counter to the idea of F1 and would be very unfair for us.,Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:18,"People say I have an aggressive style, and sometimes I don't think that is all just me. I think it's partly because I watched Senna when I was young, and I thought, 'This is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity.'",Lewis Hamilton
2021/12/15 23:32:20,"Each championship has felt different in its own way, I guess because I've been in different place of my life; I've gone through different things.",Lewis Hamilton

2021/12/15 23:32:29,"I'm in this sport to win but win by being the best, not by being lucky.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:30,I'm sure there are some things I'm not good at.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:31,"The car is a big part of it, but you need to be a good driver to get the equipment to the top. You need both.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:32,"Pretty much all the drivers I get on with, at least to say 'Hi' and have a conversation. But when the helmet's on, you don't care who it is. You have no sympathy: someone blows an engine in front of you, if it means you gain a position, then you're smiling.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:33,I'm not very patient.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:34,"I'd prefer no practices and just Saturday, Sunday. Just qualify Saturday morning, race Saturday afternoon, and race again Sunday. Less laps of nonsense and more laps of meaningful business.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:35,"If I am putting myself out there and taking some of these risks, then I want to do it properly.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:37,"When you're young, the temptation is maybe to think, 'More is more.' But a lot of the time less is more.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:39,I try to wake up naturally but set an alarm so I don't sleep in too late.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:40,"With racing, there's not one thing you need to be really strong at, it's a combination. You need a good base of cardio, good core, good neck strength. I think core and neck are the most important, but it's certainly not my favourite. Neck training is pretty boring.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:42,I do a bit of Brazilian ju-jitsu when I can. I like a bit of that.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:43,"I was fascinated by racing as a kid, but no way would I have thought I'd make it into Formula One from here, from being from Perth, racing on little local go-kart tracks, you know.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:44,"I'm very competitive. If I have to 'turn it on,' I know how to. The switch isn't hard to find, don't worry.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:45,Dale Earnhardt was kind of a hero of mine.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:46,"I don't see my family often enough, but when we do catch up, it's somewhere new in the world. They get to travel more than they would if I wasn't doing this sport.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:47,"The day I do get a championship-winning car, I will run with it. I will capitalise on every part of that beautiful thing.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:49,"I feel like even if I was to, say, trip and fall over on the way to the car and scratch all my arm, by the time I got in the car, it would be blacked out in my head.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:50,"I love mountain-biking or any form of bikes, like dirt bikes; I love getting out there, although obviously I have to be careful.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:51,"When you spend time working on something for a time period, and then it doesn't correlate, it decreases in your motivation.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:52,This sport's crazy.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:53,I've never really been too fussed about the kind of teammate I have.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:54,"People might call me a liar for this, but I want a fast teammate, I think for two reasons: it's always going to get more out of yourself, and it's always going to be a more true evaluation of where you stand.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:56,"I like having as many team-mates as possible. It's great, because the more people you can learn off, the better I think it will make you as a driver.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:57,"In racing, things start coming up quicker, and the slipstream is stronger, so even judging in the mirrors how quick the cars are approaching isn't always easy.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:58,I would like it to be remembered; I would love to be World Champion one day and have my name on the list. That is the real dream - although I am sure it is the dream for pretty much all the Formula 1 drivers.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:32:59,"For my family, it was quite emotional because it has always been a dream of mine to be in Formula 1. For them, to see it come true was quite a special feeling.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:01,"I like high speed corners, but with the F111, it is taking a little time to build up to that.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:02,"In the end, you have to just pull the trigger. Trust the car, trust the brakes, just go.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:03,"On a bad day, I'll still have a conscious thing in my mind reminding me that what I think of as a bad day is still a very good day in probably 90% of the world's population's eyes.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:05,"I signed a dog collar. Someone gave me their dog - a live dog - and I signed its collar. When they handed me the dog, I didn't know what to do. That was weird.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:06,"I'm the most ripped guy on the grid, let's just say that.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:07,"Sometimes you have a bad day, and you're like, 'I'm over this, and I just want to play tennis,' or do another sport that doesn't require any other variables, but then you have a good day, and it's like, it's amazing, and the success makes up for it.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:08,Music is how I unwind. I love going to see bands or DJs at a festival or a dive bar. My taste is pretty diverse.,Daniel Ricciardo

2021/12/15 23:33:11,"Being an F1 driver is a crazy job but not what everyone expects. My year consists of 20% driving and 80% media, marketing, and travel.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:12,"The way I see it is if I can't be happy doing this job, which is my dream job, then what's going to make me happy in life?",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:13,"Formula One was just cool. I loved racing, all types of racing, but from a young age, Formula One was the noise and everything, and that's what I was drawn to. I already knew when I was younger, the coolest guys are in F1... not that NASCAR drivers aren't cool, but that was always what I had in my head!",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:14,"Singing is definitely something I'm not good at. I wish I could be good at it, but that's a skill I definitely don't have.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:16,"I enjoyed physical education and lunch time. The social aspect of school was great, but as soon as I left school, I wanted to get out there and race. I couldn't sit still for long.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:17,"Because of my schedule and dietary requirements, I don't party a lot, but when I can let my hair down, I will; I think that's healthy. I love a weekend in Vegas.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:18,"As far as the outside things goes with Red Bull - I like the brand a lot, and obviously, I like the team a lot. We've always been a good fit for each other, so from that side, it's all been really good.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:19,"When I came into Red Bull, everyone thought, 'He's just the happy, nice guy; he's fast, but he can't race hard with these top guys.' That was a reputation I had to dismiss.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:21,"We know - relationships in this sport, it's very hard to have a really great relationship.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:22,I don't like letting anyone down. Not many people get satisfaction out of letting others down.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:23,I will be happier if I crash by trying than not trying and running around behind the same guy for 70 laps.,Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:24,"People have seen now I am a racer, and I have big intentions in the sport, and I am prepared to get my shoulders out if I need to.",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:25,2014 is a year I'll remember for a long time - it was definitely a breakthrough in my mind as well. Standing on the top step of the podium a few times was icing on the cake.,Daniel Ricciardo

2021/12/15 23:33:28,"To get the Red Bull junior drive was like a massive pressure off... I didn't have to go around asking Mum and Dad to sell their house or ask friends for funding. The instant feeling was, 'Oh wow, amazing.'",Daniel Ricciardo
2021/12/15 23:33:29,"In Formula 1, you need a great level of endurance because the races are long, so you need a pretty good base endurance.",Daniel Ricciardo

2021/12/15 23:33:31,"I feel '14 didn't just shape me and my approach from then on: it changed the level of overtaking from other guys in the sport as well. Not many people were doing that, coming from a long way back and trying big passing moves.",Daniel Ricciardo

2021/12/15 23:33:53,"I kind of look up to Lewis, not as a hero, but as a very good driver who is very fast. Everyone has to admire his pace, especially in qualifying. He is a driver I support, in terms of him being British, and I want him to win, but he isn't an idol to me.",Lando Norris

2021/12/15 23:35:15,"At the end of your life, it's friendships, emotions and thoughts that you take with you, rather than what's in your bank account. So, even though people don't have a lot here, they are a lot richer in many ways and we can learn from that.",Sebastian Vettel

2021/12/15 23:35:24,"I was quite emotional when I finished my lap, but had to wait for other drivers to cross the line to hear whether I'd actually done it. It feels very special, but I acknowledge that the old master, Nigel Mansell, took his 14 poles from only 16 races.",Sebastian Vettel
2021/12/15 23:35:25,"It was an unbelievable experience! The brakes, the g-forces and the power of the engine are beyond description. Thanks to BMW and WilliamsF1 for giving me this chance to test. The test team looked after me brilliantly and I learnt plenty.",Sebastian Vettel

2021/12/15 23:37:10,"With F1, it's really a combination of many things. You have to have good endurance, good strength in certain muscles, you need to be fast, have good reactions and good decisions. It's not as simple as one thing. You need to be a complete athlete.",Valtteri Bottas

2021/12/15 23:37:27,Those who have come into Formula One without experiencing cars devoid of electronic aids will find it tough. To control 800 horse power relying just on arm muscles and foot sensitivity can turn out to be a dangerous exercise.,Michael Schumacher

2021/12/15 23:37:58,"I didn't have statistics in my mind when I was racing. It was always a consequence - a nice consequence. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the reason I was racing.",Michael Schumacher
2021/12/15 23:37:59,"The first thing, when I got the money, I knew I would support somebody. And the person I supported was my family. Because we were really in debt with the money.

2021/12/15 23:38:28,"In life, it's winning - when I go to the supermarket, and I go with a friend, I try to get through the door first. Things like that - everything in life is a competition for me.",Fernando Alonso

2021/12/15 23:38:36,"It is true - maybe with five or seven points more, I could be five times world champion.

So I just take the positives, and I am happy with my achievements.",Fernando Alonso

2021/12/15 23:38:39,"You can play basketball and have a magic night and score 40 points with your team-mates and win the game.

2021/12/15 23:39:05,"I think it is very important to not be too much on social media. You have a lot of positive comments but also negative ones, and at the end of the day, that shouldn't affect you, but it is much more important not to read it so you just don't know.",Max Verstappen

2021/12/15 23:39:23,"It changes from track-to-track, but when you are behind someone, you know after a few laps where they are weaker and stronger around the lap.

The G-force when you take big corners is like someone trying to rip your head off. You hit the brakes, and it feels as if the skin is being pulled off your body.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:26,"To drive an F1 car you have to be a little mad. On the morning of a race there's a mix of excitement and fear. If it's a wet track, then it's worse as you're not in control most of the time, which is the thing all drivers fear the most.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:27,We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff.

2021/12/15 23:40:31,When it comes to my racing career I'm very driven and very selfish. People who are around me at races will know that I'm a different person here than in my personal life. I completely blank people at races. I need to be focused. I'm rude.,Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:33,"I think as a 20-year-old you expect life to always be easy. You get given a good hand and the chance to race in Formula One. You think the driver can make the difference, can make up for everything else within the team. But that is not the case. You are racing in such a competitive sport so that doesn't happen.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:34,We all drive differently and have different styles. For me I need a car I can develop beneath me and feel comfortable in. If the car feels neutral and unbalanced it doesn't work for me.,Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:35,"I love cycling, running and swimming. In recent years I've competed regularly in triathlons, which means I don't find the physical side of driving a struggle any more.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:37,"When I'm on my own, I can be negative. I need my friends and family around to help pick me up if I've had a bad qualifying session. I think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:40,"I don't purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn't give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can't go fast enough. It's never going to be anything like an F1 car.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:41,"My 'Movember' moustache was never going to be as big as Nigel Mansell's, but I tried my best. The amazing thing is that when you try to grow a moustache, you notice everyone else's. There are some amazing moustaches on the grid.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:42,"I can't eat whatever I want, definitely not. I'm always controlled because I do a lot of fitness and triathlons, not just Formula One, so I always make sure I eat the right things.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:45,"I've spent as much as 30 grand on a watch but it's not about flaunting my wealth. I don't have many extravagances but watches are my biggest one. I must have 30 of them now. I've been collecting since the age of nine, when I won a black TAG in a karting event.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:46,"Yeah, I'm the Brit who isn't Lewis Hamilton that woke up and realised he was good. I got that tag because I was young, flying around in jets and driving fast cars. I always took my driving seriously, but I suppose I enjoyed life... But I'm not a playboy.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:48,"I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I'm 6ft and I'm 70kg so I haven't much fat on me.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:52,"A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we're pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:40:53,"My time at Honda was amazing. Some of my best times in Formula One, actually. I might not have won races, just one race, but I had a lot of fun.",Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:40:59,"I need to develop a car and engineer a car in a position that feels comfortable for me, and I don't think anyone can do a better job than I can in that position. The problem for me is if I can't get the car there I do struggle more than some.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:41:01,"When I was in Japan with my girlfriend Jessica, she would have had acupuncture every day if she could.

2021/12/15 23:41:03,My school reports always used to point out that my concentration levels were appalling. I never listened in class because I was always daydreaming about racing.

2021/12/15 23:41:08,"I think social networks are really working for the drivers, because we're able to talk directly to fans and they get first-hand information. And I think it's great for the partners as well and the businesses that are involved in Formula One.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:41:09,"If someone was making a movie about F1 in the last six months, they wouldn't need to add a Hollywood ending. If they do make that movie, it's got to be 'The Curious Case Of Jenson Button,' where I've lived my life backwards. I'd like Johnny Depp to play me but he wouldn't be quite right.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:41:11,The only time I think about life beyond F1 is when I contemplate becoming a dad. But there's no way that's going to happen while I'm still racing. To be successful in F1 you need to be very selfish in lots of ways and you're away from home for long periods. That's not the kind of father I want to be.,Jenson Button

2021/12/15 23:41:16,"You're pulling 4-5G for a lot of the corners around the lap. We build up lactic acid because there are a lot of vibrations in the car, and you have to have strong legs to hit the brake pedal. We need to be fit to do every lap at 100%.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:41:17,"For me, triathlons were something that was down to me and my fitness. Now, I really enjoy the pain in the triathlon of chasing someone down. It's a bit like chasing down Nico Rosberg in the last few laps at Silverstone - it makes you feel alive.",Jenson Button
2021/12/15 23:41:19,"I have to take the positives from 2012 and the negatives as well because you learn more than you do from the positives.

2021/12/15 23:44:46,It's important to drive consistently to evaluate changes that are made to the car. You need to be very accurate with your feedback and communicate as much information as possible.,Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:44:47,I've always enjoyed visiting India and we usually go to Mumbai or Delhi a few times during the season. It's a shame there is no race in India because it's a great facility and I always enjoyed racing there.,Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:44:49,"You don't get that opportunity everyday to do Le Mans with Porsche, a brand that has so much tradition and history. So I just grabbed the opportunity while it was there.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:44:49,I'm pretty excited to be racing for Williams. They're real racers.,Nico Hulkenberg

2021/12/15 23:44:51,I'm not a big fan of the halo as a device. I have to face facts - it does bring something in terms of safety.,Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:44:53,"Yes, the sound of the new V6 engines could have been a little bit better, but it is just one of those things that you get used to with time.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:44:55,Renault has always been a big player in the motorsport world that brings up incredible memories.,Nico Hulkenberg

2021/12/15 23:45:00,"My first pole position is an emotional and hopefully historic moment as I want to be in F1 for many, many years.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:01,I can't lose any more weight. I would very much like to be 10cm shorter and 10kgs lighter. It would make my life a lot easier but it is what it is. What can I do?,Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:02,"You always have some weaknesses, if you're entirely happy it means you're under-driving it.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:04,"I find it interesting as every year people say the midfield is as tight as ever but it is always tight, it is always competitive. I've pretty much spent my entire career in the midfield so I know about it!",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:05,I want a strong team-mate and one that is challenging me.,Nico Hulkenberg

2021/12/15 23:45:08,"Sometimes, especially when you are in the traffic behind other cars, you get a lot of stuff - sand, oil - and if that mixes up that can be very bad for the vision sometimes.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:09,"It is obviously always nice to start in a strong way, but it's also very important to keep that strength during the year - the season is quite long, from March to November.",Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:10,It's very difficult to predict a team's competitiveness.,Nico Hulkenberg
2021/12/15 23:45:12,"It takes leadership to improve safety. And I started off the movement in my time, but the person who has done more over the past 20 to 30 years and who has led it is Professor Sid Watkins.",Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:13,The years I raced in were fantastic. There was so much change in the cars. We went from treaded tyres to no wings right through to slicks to enormous wings.,Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:14,"We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.",Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:16,"There has been a huge advance in technology, which has improved the safety of the cars incredibly, but there are still some heavy crash impacts and in certain circumstances there is still the chance of fire today.",Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:18,Cornering is like bringing a woman to climax.,Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:20,I'm not going away. I'll still be very much involved in the team but not with the same number of hours. I need to move over and allow the people who are really doing the job the space to do so.,Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:21,"We have had more sales for this year's grand prix than any other, and we have been helped in that by the fact that Jenson had 10 podiums last season and looks like a winner. It is good for British motor racing if he is there and doing well.",Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:22,"When there is an accident involving fire, in most cases death is caused by the inhalation of the toxic smoke. What we need is air to go to a driver for 45 seconds. I'm surprised that this is not done, and I would make it compulsory.",Jackie Stewart
2021/12/15 23:45:23,There is no doubt that Formula 1 has the best risk management of any sport and any industry in the world.,Jackie Stewart

2021/12/15 23:45:29,"Without going to what I think is my limit. I always say that my ideal is to get pole with the minimum effort, and to win the race at the slowest speed possible.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:30,"The people who criticise you will not be the ones taking care of your legs when you are in your wheelchair. People who never drove a car in these conditions, they just don't know.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:31,I like the mentality of the Americans. It's like when you talk about money.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:32,It's not too good to have this attitude in F1. It could be a disadvantage.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:33,That is an important part of my success. Another big part of my success is that I hated not to finish a race.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:35,"Maybe I am not French, maybe I am from nowhere.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:36,"I think maybe the English don't want to try something and look stupid, because they are a bit reserved.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:37,You can't always have the best team. It's always a compromise.,Alain Prost

2021/12/15 23:45:39,"I have had some problems because the French don't like people to have success, they don't like the number one.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:40,I was very interested in that. It is very important to have confidence as well as to build up experience.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:41,I have always had this mentality because I hated to break anything on the car.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:42,"I remember in the first part of the race I was sixth and I could have gone quicker, but I had to go slow. It was one of the most difficult things I have ever done.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:43,In 1980 I finished three or four times in seventh place.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:44,"When I test I never go right to the limit. Only because when you are below the limit you can go at the same speed all day, and that's the only way you can be absolutely sure about what you are testing.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:45,It's like when people talk about driving F1 cars in the rain. I have absolutely no problem with it.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:46,"When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:47,I'm brave to say that I won't take this sort of risk.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:49,People don't understand that it was maybe my biggest pleasure to drive an F1 car when it's wet.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:50,I have no problem with the people who work hard to get success. But I think people are very jealous about success. I work very hard and they don't appreciate that.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:51,"So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport its the longterm. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:53,It's always better to speak the language of the team. Not only for the direct contact with everyone - sometimes it also helps you to understand the mentality of the people in the team a bit better.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:53,A German team could be quite good. But maybe they are a little bit too convinced that they are the best.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:55,"You want to have fun but you also want to work well. Sometimes I was quite happy at Ferrari, because we would have fun, but then they could not stop having fun and go back to the real work.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:56,"I always work the same way, starting from the beginning of the weekend, so I know at the beginning of the race, from all that I have analysed during the practice, whether I will win the race or not.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:57,Sometimes I think I could have got some better results if I had a different mentality; if I could have pushed hard and attacked. But then I would have had a good chance of making a mistake.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:58,One of my biggest problems this season was with the clutch at the start of the race. I hate to risk the car.,Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:45:59,"I don't like to go over curbs, because I don't want to be hard on the car.",Alain Prost
2021/12/15 23:46:01,"I find it incredibly annoying going to every race to finish seventh, or even fifth.",Carlos Sainz Jr

2021/12/15 23:46:03,I had no idea at two or three years of age that my dad was a rally driver and he was doing doughnuts around the world.,Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:04,Politics is something that is bigger than many people would think and you just need to learn how to deal with them and how to accept it and how to treat them. I think that from when you are 10 years old and you look at F1 and don't realise it's there and then it is.,Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:05,"My recommendation is to try and do the best you can in go-karting to be spotted by a big name like Red Bull or Ferrari. And like that you have a chance. If not, nowadays it's very difficult. It's always been, but these days, even more.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:07,In an F1 team at the end you have your little family and I feel that Red Bull is definitely mine and my place to be at the moment.,Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:09,"Everyone on the grid gets nervous before a Formula 1 race. It's just how you manage it. It's impossible not to be a bit nervous before a Formula 1 start or even before a World Series start. You have nerves. The thing is, you know how to control them.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:10,"My Dad has given me a lot of advice, but this advice comes especially from the attitude point of view. He's never told me how to drive a car, how to do a corner, nothing like that. He believe this comes from the talent. You are born with it or you are not born with it.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:11,"When there's a rule that you can use only three engines for the whole season, and you are a team that is not worried about 2018, you are worried about being world champions in 2020, you need to make progress.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:12,"When I jumped in a go-kart at three or four, with my friends, I was super fast without anyone really teaching me.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:14,"You can imagine the long process and what you need to do as a driver to extract the maximum out of the car, what you need to do as a driver talking to the team about what you need, but what also the team can do for you to make that happen.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:16,"You never stop learning in F1. It's the typical thing that all drivers say, but it's absolutely true. But also, apart from driving, you learn a bit about the political side of F1. People don't realise how much there is outside the car.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:17,The day you perform at the highest level you need your car to be best of the rest.,Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:18,"This feels like a new start for me because it is my first two-year deal, a long-term project in F1. People sometimes underestimate how important that is for a driver to perform. To have that confidence, that support, that mutual trust.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:19,"I think the people that need to see my talent are seeing it, people who understand F1 well are valuing my performance.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:20,"Having two teams with the same engine and being used to being really close to each other which is the case with Red Bull and Toro Rosso, I think we can do a big step forward if we work together and there's a good relationship between the teams.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:21,"I do try rallying. I do like rallying a lot. We have a rally car there in the countryside in Madrid. And everytime I'm there, I just jump in and have some fun. I really like rallying.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:23,"There is clearly this gene inside me or this thing inside me that I've always had in my blood. I don't know, but since very little I've always wanted to be in racing cars, and that was without knowing who my dad was and what he was doing for a living.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:24,"As a driver, it's very important to feel at home and feel that the team wants you. I've always felt at McLaren it was pretty much love at first sight since we started talking.",Carlos Sainz Jr
2021/12/15 23:46:26,"There will always be jealous people and haters: people who assume that if they were in your shoes, they could do what you're doing. That's just the world we live in.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:46:32,"Don't get me wrong: I've had a lot of fortune, to come where I've come from, to be able to move to Europe, to go racing. But I had that fortune behind me. I grabbed it with both hands, and I made the best of it.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:46:41,The crucial thing for me is that I stick to my job.,Lance Stroll
2021/12/15 23:46:42,"I come from a background that, when I win, people try to put me down, and when I lose, people try to put me down. I accept that, and I actually find it kind of funny.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:46:46,"I think Formula One is - there's a lot of differences from track to track, grip levels, tyre compound, so you always have to press the reset button and work from scratch again.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:47:12,"I've really just had to learn and adapt more than ever before, because there's so much to do in F1. There's so much to be on top of as a driver. It really requires perfection just to walk out of a weekend with a decent result.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:47:14,"If the car is capable of finishing eighth, then I want to get the most out of the car and put it eighth. If the car is only capable of finishing 13th to start the year, then that has to be our goal.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:47:24,"Of course we go to Montreal to work as hard as we can and do the best we can, the same way we go everything, but I think if we always think we need to score points, we start forgetting about the stuff we have to do to get there.",Lance Stroll

I think that's the best way to look at it, because then you start focusing on the outcome rather than focusing on the work that it takes to get to that outcome.",Lance Stroll
2021/12/15 23:47:32,"There are people who are hating you more because of where you are coming from. People like the 'he comes from nothing and made it to F1' story. I know that, but I just do my thing; I focus on my job.",Lance Stroll

2021/12/15 23:53:33,"If I had to pick favourite parts of Interlagos, I would say the first and last corners. The first corner is really technical and punishes you if you get it wrong, while the last corner is so fast and really puts quite a strain on your body. As a driver, I really enjoy these corners.",Romain Grosjean

2021/12/15 23:53:39,"Monaco is quite a specialist track, and it is very difficult to say if a car will be suited to it or not. It's bumpy on the straights, and it's a very low-grip surface. All these things mean that you never know what to expect.",Romain Grosjean

2021/12/15 23:54:57,"Red Bull is an energy drinks company operating a team in F1, of course it doesn't sit particularly well when you are competing against iconic brands like Ferrari and Mercedes. We are happy to be perceived as a bit of a maverick.",Christian Horner

2021/12/15 23:55:08,"If the racing series does not exist for a year, then it disappears in its entirety. Teams that have been operating very close to the limit just wouldn't survive. They rely on racing to generate income and to fulfill their obligations to the promoter.",Christian Horner
2021/12/15 23:55:10,I did a deal with my parents to take a year out before university at the end of 1992 to try and forge a career in motor sport. I still haven't gone. I left school at 18 and that was it.,Christian Horner

2021/12/15 23:55:15,"I think F1, ultimately, is man and machine at its absolute limit. It is modern day chariot racing.",Christian Horner
2021/12/15 23:55:17,"You've got different governments and manufacturers saying, 'Oh, we'll be electric and autonomous by 2030 or whatever.' In my view Formula One is at a crossroads.
